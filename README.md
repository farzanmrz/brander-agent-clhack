# BranderAgent

AI-powered personal branding agent for Twitter/X. Define your brand "spheres" (topics, tone, goals), and the agent discovers relevant tweets and trending content, drafts on-brand replies using your voice, and learns from your feedback over time. Built for the Continual Learning Hackathon by Creators Corner (Feb 2026).
