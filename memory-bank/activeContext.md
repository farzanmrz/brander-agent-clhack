# Active Context: BranderAgent

## Current Focus
Initial project setup and memory bank initialization.

## Recent Changes
- Created project directory `brander-agent-clhack`.
- Initialized local git repo and renamed branch to `main`.
- Created `README.md` and `LICENSE` (MIT).
- Created public GitHub repository `farzanmrz/brander-agent-clhack` and pushed initial commit.
- Initialized `memory-bank/` with `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.

## Next Steps
1. Complete memory bank initialization (`activeContext.md` and `progress.md`).
2. Create `requirements.txt`.
3. Set up conda environment and install dependencies.
4. Set up `.env` template.
5. Initialize FastAPI app structure.

## Active Decisions
- Use plain Python functions for API orchestration (no LangChain).
- Priority: Working end-to-end demo over UI polish.
- Gemini as default LLM.

## Notes on Developer (Farzan)
- Strong Python/ML engineering.
- Intermediate full-stack, weak frontend.
- Needs to be kept focused on core features to avoid scope creep.
- Working under a tight 5.5-hour deadline (starts 11 AM PT).
